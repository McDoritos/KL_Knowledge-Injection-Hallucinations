      "1. **Light Scattering**: Sunlight consists of different wavelengths, with violet and blue light having shorter wavelengths. When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it collides with molecules like nitrogen and oxygen. These collisions scatter the light in all directions.\n",

      "2. **Wavelength Preference**: Shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more efficiently than longer wavelengths (like red and yellow). This means blue light is spread out more uniformly across the sky, while violet light is scattered but less prominently.\n",

      "3. **Human Vision**: Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than violet. Even though both wavelengths are scattered, the human eye's sensitivity to blue contributes to the perception of the sky as blue.\n",

      "4. **Time of Day**: During sunrise or sunset, the sky appears red or orange because the longer wavelength red light is scattered less and dominates the view. At midday, blue light is scattered more, creating the blue sky.\n",

      "In summary, the sky's blue color is a result of Rayleigh scattering, the dominance of blue light, and our visual sensitivity.\n",

      "The sky appears blue primarily due to **Rayleigh scattering**—a physical process where sunlight interacts with the gases and particles in Earth's atmosphere. Here's a clear, step-by-step explanation:\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Sunlight is white light, but it contains all colors**\n",
      "   - Sunlight (visible light) is a mix of colors (wavelengths) ranging from red (longest wavelength, ~700 nm) to violet (shortest, ~400 nm).\n",
      "   - When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with nitrogen, oxygen, and tiny dust particles.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Rayleigh scattering: Why blue scatters more**\n",
      "   - **How it works**: Light scatters more when the particles it hits are **much smaller than its wavelength** (like air molecules). This is called **Rayleigh scattering** (named after Lord Rayleigh).\n",
      "   - **Why blue?**: Shorter wavelengths (blue/violet light) scatter **much more strongly** than longer wavelengths (red/orange). Specifically:\n",
      "     - Scattering intensity ∝ **1 / (wavelength)⁴**\n",
      "     - Blue light (λ ≈ 450 nm) scatters **~9 times more** than red light (λ ≈ 650 nm).\n",
      "   - **Result**: Blue light spreads out in all directions from the atmosphere, reaching your eyes from all angles. This makes the sky appear blue during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Why isn't the sky violet? (A common question!)**\n",
      "   - Violet light (shorter wavelength than blue) scatters **even more** than blue. But the sky isn't violet because:\n",
      "     - **Human eyes are less sensitive to violet**: Our eyes have three types of color receptors (cones). Blue cones are more sensitive than violet cones, so we perceive blue more strongly.\n",
      "     - **Sunlight has less violet light**: The sun emits slightly less violet light than blue (due to how the sun's spectrum works).\n",
      "     - **Atmospheric absorption**: Some violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere before reaching your eyes.\n",
      "   - *So, blue dominates the perception*—not violet!\n",

      "\n",

      "     1. Scatters most blue light away.\n",
